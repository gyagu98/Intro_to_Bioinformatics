# Intro_to_Bioinformatics
This repo shows some of the work I did during my Bioinformatics course during Spring 2023

My main project of this course was to run sequence analyses on Crotalus (rattlesnakes) species and compare them in high vs low altitude settings

I used R console in its entirety throughout the course
